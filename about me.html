	<p> I live from a small town along the coast of Oregon. My hobbies, when I am not studying in school, are writing stories, dancing, playing flute, and just being with my family! </p>
		<p>I have been doing Ballet throughout my entire life, starting from when I was 3 years old. When I got to college, it was no different as I continued to learn and excel at Ballet! Along with taking college Ballet classes, I have also joined various academies throughout my life. I believe that Ballet is a way to be able to speak without using words and is a beautiful work of art.</p>
	<p>Flute was no different for me than my ballet experience. I picked it up by myself and started playing when I was around 13. Since then I have had lessons, taught beginner lessons, and continue to search for ways to introduce this beautiful instrument to the world. Flute is another way I like to express myself and my feelings through the music.</p>
